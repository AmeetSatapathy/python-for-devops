Great! Let's go through the **Lambda function Python code** line by line so you understand exactly what it's doing.

---

### ✅ **Full Line-by-Line Explanation**

```python
import boto3
```

* Imports the **Boto3 SDK**, which is the official AWS SDK for Python.
* This allows your Lambda function to interact with AWS services (like EC2, S3, etc.).

---

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone, timedelta
```

* Imports classes from Python’s built-in `datetime` module:

  * `datetime`: represents date and time.
  * `timezone`: used to define the UTC timezone.
  * `timedelta`: used for time calculations (e.g., subtracting 30 days).

---

```python
import os
```

* Imports the `os` module to read environment variables (like `RETENTION_DAYS`).

---

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
```

* This is the **entry point** for the Lambda function.
* AWS calls this function automatically when the Lambda is triggered.
* `event`: contains event data (not used here).
* `context`: contains metadata about the invocation, function, and execution environment.

---

```python
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
```

* Creates a Boto3 **client** to interact with **Amazon EC2**.
* You'll use this client to list and delete EBS snapshots.

---

```python
    retention_days = int(os.environ.get('RETENTION_DAYS', 30))
```

* Reads the `RETENTION_DAYS` environment variable from Lambda config.
* If it's not set, defaults to **30 days**.

---

```python
    now = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
```

* Gets the **current date and time** in UTC.
* Needed to compare snapshot creation times.

---

```python
    cutoff = now - timedelta(days=retention_days)
```

* Calculates the **cutoff datetime**: any snapshot older than this is considered **stale**.
* Example: if `retention_days` is 30, this gives you the timestamp for "30 days ago."

---

```python
    snapshots = ec2.describe_snapshots(OwnerIds=['self'])['Snapshots']
```

* Calls `describe_snapshots()` to fetch all EBS snapshots **owned by your account** (`'self'`).
* Returns a dictionary; we extract the list under the key `'Snapshots'`.

---

```python
    deleted = 0
```

* Initializes a counter to keep track of how many snapshots are deleted.

---

```python
    for snapshot in snapshots:
```

* Loops through all the snapshots returned by the API.

---

```python
        start_time = snapshot['StartTime']
        snapshot_id = snapshot['SnapshotId']
```

* Extracts:

  * `start_time`: when the snapshot was created (datetime object).
  * `snapshot_id`: the unique ID used to identify the snapshot.

---

```python
        if start_time < cutoff:
```

* Checks if the snapshot is **older** than the retention period.
* If yes, it's stale and should be deleted.

---

```python
            print(f"Deleting snapshot {snapshot_id} from {start_time}")
```

* Logs the ID and creation time of the snapshot being deleted (visible in CloudWatch Logs).

---

```python
            ec2.delete_snapshot(SnapshotId=snapshot_id)
```

* Deletes the snapshot using its ID.

---

```python
            deleted += 1
```

* Increments the counter of deleted snapshots.

---

```python
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': f"Deleted {deleted} stale snapshots older than {retention_days} days"
    }
```

* Returns a **JSON response** with HTTP status 200 and a message indicating how many snapshots were deleted.

---

### ✅ Summary

* This Lambda function is safe, clean, and efficient for automating snapshot cleanup.
* You can tune it using the `RETENTION_DAYS` environment variable.
* Make sure it has the correct IAM role permissions to avoid failure at runtime.
